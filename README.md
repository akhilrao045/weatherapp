# API Key Setup
To use the OpenWeather API, you need to sign up on their website to obtain an API key. Once you have the API key, create a file named config.js in the project directory and store your API key in it as follows:

#E javascript

// config.js const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key.
